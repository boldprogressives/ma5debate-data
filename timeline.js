Banks need to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and made accountable.All \"pork\" on legislation needs to be eliminated!The President needs line item veto power, just like many State governors have.The military budget can be fixed not by limiting promotions (a moral issue), but by stopping PCS moves every two years. By keeping pilots in the cockpit until they retire or leave the service. It makes no sense to spend millions training someone to fly and then when they are at their peck in experience pull them out of the cockpit to fly a desk. This is so true of Commissioned officers in all branches. The only pilots who get to fly their entire career are Army Warrants.What is your stance on these issues?",
