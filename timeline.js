If necessary, \"occupation settlements\" should be dismantled or given to Palestinians.* Israel and Palestine must allow Jerusalem to be split or shared.* Palestine must give up the \"right of return,\" which would be suicide for Israel.* Israel must give up the extreme Zionist dream of an Israel drawn up according to biblical borders.* Israel must give up the dream of sole ownership of all of Jerusalem.* Agreement to any of these principles should not be a precondition for negotiations.  However, Israel should cease development of occupation settlements, and Palestine should do everything it can to prevent terrorist attacks on Israel during negotiations.  Extremists should not be allowed to destroy negotiations. * Finally, the U.S. should not give unconditional support to either party, and should be willing to withhold support (financial and otherwise) from either party if recalcitrant.",
