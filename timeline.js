      "submission": " Where do you stand on the Employee Free Choice Act? It would give workers and the union the right to insist on using card check, rather than a secret-ballot election, to determine whether a majority of workers want a union.Unions prefer card check to secret-ballot elections largely because it is more successful in unionizing shops; in fact they argue that the election process has grown so unfair that it has become a major reason for the decline in union membership among private-sector employees. The unions argue that the 40-day or 60-day campaign before a union election is skewed in favor of an employer, as union organizers are barred from company property.The employer, meanwhile, has 24/7 access to employees and can hold group or one-on-one meetings or take other steps to turn the workforce against unionization.  And thus the secret ballot is not necessary for having a stronger union (and is detrimental).",
