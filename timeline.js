Additionally, the groups using \"lobbyists\" (often former elected officials with \"contacts\" in Congress), are able to deduct the expenses of lobbying from their taxable income.  It is tax-deductible bribery by the \"haves\" in order to maintain their ascendency over the \"have-nots,\" and should be illegal.   Do you support eliminating lobbying?  If so, how will you go about getting rid of it; if not, why not?",
