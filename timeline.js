      "submission": "\"Lobbying\" is essentially a legal method for wealthy corporations and special interest groups to obtain legislation and subsidies not available to individual American citizens and small businesses.  Additionally, the groups using \"lobbyists\" (often former elected officials with \"contacts\" in Congress), are able to deduct the expenses of lobbying from their taxable income.  It is tax-deductible bribery by the \"haves\" in order to maintain their ascendency over the \"have-nots,\" and should be illegal.   Do you support eliminating lobbying?  If so, how will you go about getting rid of it; if not, why not?",
