Will their be a cap on the increase they can pass on to me yearly.? Currently I have Blue Cross HMO, I am disable, my only source of income is my monthly Social Security Check, which is not enough to cover my daily living. We need a increase to match how expensive it is in today economy. Each year my premium is increase by $100.00. Can you have them limit the amount of increase yearly, especially with individual like myself that the government state my income is at the poverty level.  I would kindly appreciate it. The yearly increase is causing me hardship.Respectfully,Allie Blackof Washington, DC",

I walked my own path these many years since. I have watched this earth be abused to the point of, change is here...I have watched one man after another turn its back on our constitution, allowing special interest to control judge and rule.My question :Can you stop  the Bush Clinton era now, by deporting illegals,more laws against guns, Stop Oil now not in 20 years.  go green now thats my  question  When do we honor the earth and stop this group of IDIOTS  . thanks  glenn",
